Project Description:
For this project, I made a working calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It looks like the iPhone IOS calculator and works on both desktop and mobile screens. The calculator can add, subtract, multiply, divide, show percentages, change signs, and handle decimals. I also made sure users can use the keyboard to type in numbers. I added the calculator as the first project on my portfolio website.

Challenges:
One of the hard parts was getting the full math expression to show as users typed. At first, only the number showed, but I fixed it by adding an extra display line. I also had to make sure the calculator looked good on all screen sizes, which I did by adjusting the CSS.

Extra Features:

Shows the full math expression

Works with keyboard input

"Back to Portfolio" link

Looks good on phones and computers

Resources I Used:
I used W3 schools to look up JavaScript. I also looked at Github and VSCode help pages. The calculator style was inspired by the iPhone version, but I made my own design and code using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
