Assignment 4: The Exciting World of JavaScript
Part 0 - Environment Setup
This is Part 0 of Assignment 4: "The Exciting World of JavaScript", focused on setting up your JavaScript development environment. While this part will not be graded, it's essential to complete it before moving on to the graded portions of the assignment. The goal is to ensure everyone has a working JavaScript environment before we dive deeper into programming concepts.

Required Tasks
1. Installing Node.js
If you don't already have Node.js installed:

Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version recommended for most users

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

Windows: Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts
Mac: Run the downloaded pkg installer or use Homebrew with brew install node
Linux: Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., apt install nodejs npm for Ubuntu)
Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:

node -v
npm -v
Both commands should display version numbers if installation was successful

2. "Hello JavaScript" Program
Create a simple JavaScript file (/assignments/assignment-4/hello.js) that:

Outputs "Hello, JavaScript!" to the console
Includes at least one variable
Includes at least one function
Uses at least one ES6+ feature (arrow function, template literal, etc.)
Example:

// hello.js
const greeting = "JavaScript";

const createMessage = (name) => {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(createMessage(greeting));
Run your JavaScript file using Node.js:

Open a terminal/command prompt
Navigate to the directory containing your hello.js file
Run the file with:
node hello.js
You should see your output message in the terminal
3. Browser Experiment
Create a simple HTML page /assignments/assignment-4/index.html that:

Links to your JavaScript file
Contains a button that, when clicked, calls a function from your JavaScript file
Displays some dynamic content on the page when the button is clicked
Example HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Practice</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>JavaScript Week 0 Practice</h1>
    <button id="greetButton">Click Me!</button>
    <div id="output"></div>
    
    <script src="hello.js"></script>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("greetButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
            document.getElementById("output").textContent = createMessage("JavaScript");
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
4. Explore Browser DevTools
Open your HTML page in Chrome or Firefox
Open the developer tools (F12)
Experiment with:
Running JavaScript in the console
Inspecting DOM elements
Setting breakpoints in your JavaScript code
Viewing network requests
5. Enable GitHub Pages for Your Repository
Set up GitHub Pages to host your HTML and JavaScript files:

Push your files to your GitHub repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Add JavaScript assignment files"
git push
Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to your repository on GitHub
Click on "Settings" (tab in the top navigation bar)
Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
Under "Source", select "main branch"
Click "Save"
Wait a few minutes for your site to deploy (you'll see a green success message with a URL)

Visit your GitHub Pages URL to verify your HTML page works correctly online

The URL format will be: https://yourusername.github.io/CSC317/
You may need to add the filename to the URL if your HTML file is not named index.html, for example: https://yourusername.github.io/CSC317/index.html
Make note of this URL as you'll need it for future parts of the assignment

Part 1 - JS Calculator
Overview
For this project, you'll create a fully functional calculator that mimics the design and functionality of the iOS/Android calculator app. This project will let you apply the JavaScript fundamentals we've covered in our first week, including DOM manipulation, event handling, functions, and more.

Requirements
Core Functionality
Your calculator should implement these basic operations:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Clear functionality (AC button)
Positive/negative toggle
Percentage calculation
Decimal point input
Equals operation
User Interface
Create a grid-based layout similar to the iOS calculator
Include a display area showing the current input/result
Design should include:
Number buttons (0-9)
Operation buttons (+, -, ร, รท)
Utility buttons (AC, +/-, %, =)
Decimal point button (.)
Apply appropriate colors and styling:
Dark background
Light colored text
Orange operation buttons
Gray utility buttons
Dark gray number buttons
Technical Requirements
Use vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)
Create a responsive design that works on different screen sizes
Implement keyboard support for numbers and operations
Handle edge cases (division by zero, etc.)
Implement proper input validation
Use event listeners for button clicks and keyboard input
Apply ES6+ features where appropriate
Implementation Steps
1. HTML Structure
Create the calculator container
Add the display area
Create a grid for the buttons
Add all necessary buttons with appropriate labels
2. CSS Styling
Set up the grid layout
Style the display area
Format the buttons (colors, shapes, sizes)
Add hover/active states for buttons
Make the design responsive
3. JavaScript Functionality
Implement functions to:
Capture and display button inputs
Perform calculations
Handle special functions (AC, +/-, %)
Process and display results
Add keyboard event listeners
Implement secure evaluation of expressions
Handle error cases
Project Deliverables
Complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
A README.md explaining your implementation choices
Host your calculator on GitHub Pages
Submit the GitHub repository link
Evaluation Criteria
Functionality: Does the calculator work correctly?
Code Quality: Is the code well-organized and error free?
Design: Does it look similar to the iOS/Android calculator?
User Experience: Is it intuitive and easy to use?
Error Handling: Does it handle edge cases gracefully?
Implementation of JavaScript concepts covered in lectures
Tips
Start by implementing the basic UI
Add number input functionality first
Then implement basic operations one at a time
Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next
Don't worry about complex operations initially
Use console.log() for debugging
Consider using separate functions for different responsibilities
Test keyboard input separately from button clicks
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Node.js Installation Problems
Windows: Make sure to run the installer as administrator
Mac: If using Homebrew, make sure brew is updated with brew update
Linux: You might need to add sudo before installation commands
JavaScript File Not Running
Make sure you're in the correct directory when running node hello.js
Check file permissions (especially on Mac/Linux)
Verify there are no syntax errors in your code
Browser Integration Issues
Check browser console (F12) for any error messages
Ensure the file path to your JavaScript is correct
Try using a different browser if problems persist
GitHub Pages Issues
Make sure your repository is public (GitHub Pages doesn't work with private repositories on free accounts)
Check that your files are in the main branch
Remember that GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update after changes
If your site shows a 404 error, make sure your file paths are correct and case-sensitive
For repository-level GitHub Pages, your files need to be at the root level or correctly referenced
Part 2 - Portfolio Integration
Overview
In this part of the assignment, you'll integrate your JavaScript calculator from Part 1 into your personal portfolio website from Assignment 3. This will give you practice with linking between pages, organizing project files, and presenting your work professionally.

Requirements
