# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
This assignment compared four different CSS stylesheets: ai-1.css, ai-2.css, hybrid.css, and styles.css. Each had a different design approach. ai-1.css had a professional look with a navy blue and teal color scheme. It used CSS variables for consistency, a fixed navigation bar, and clear typography. It also had hover effects and animations for buttons, images, and sections. ai-2.css was based on a sunset theme, using warm colors like orange, gold, yellow, and blue. It had a gradient background and soft shadows, making it visually interesting but less traditional.
Hybrid.css combined elements from styles.css, ai-1.css, and ai-2.css, mixing professional and warm colors. It had a gradient header, clean typography, and smooth hover effects. Styles.css was simple and easy to read, using a blue color scheme and a structured layout. It had a clean navigation bar, good spacing, and subtle hover effects. This made it a traditional portfolio style focused on clarity.


## Lessons Learned
I learned that using CSS variables in the root folder makes it easier to keep a website's colors consistent. I also realized that while bright colors can look nice, they should not make text hard to read. Adding small animations like hover effects makes a website feel more interactive without being overwhelming. Making sure a design works well on different screen sizes is very important for usability. Lastly, hybrid.css showed that combining different styles can create a design that is both professional and visually appealing.

## Preferred Version
I prefer hybrid.css because it balances professionalism and creativity. It keeps the clean layout and readable text while adding warm colors for a more appealing look. The hover effects and animations make the design feel modern and engaging without being too flashy. It also maintains good readability and organization, ensuring the portfolio remains clear and easy to navigate. This is why it is my favorite version.
